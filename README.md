## Mermaid

Mermaid is a markup language that allows for the creation of diagrams and charts with a syntax inspired by Markdown. For more information on mermaid please visit their [Github page](https://github.com/mermaid-js) or their [docs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).

## Features

Iemanja is still in development but as of now these are some of the features that it has:

1. Exporting diagrams as `.svg`.
2. Creating, saving and loading `.mmd` files.
3. Live rendering of graphs/diagrams
4. Mermaid editing (through [monaco-editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor))
5. Mermaid parser errors (Work in progress)
6. Mermaid syntax highlighting (Work in progress)

## Use case

Iemanja aims to provide a more fully fledged editing, theming and exporting experience locally. However, if you want to give Meramid a quick try feel free to use the official mermaid online [live editor](https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/#/edit/eyJjb2RlIjoiZ3JhcGggVERcbiAgICBBW0hhcmRdIC0tPnxUZXh0fCBCKFJvdW5kKVxuICAgIEIgLS0-IEN7RGVjaXNpb259XG4gICAgQyAtLT58T25lfCBEW1Jlc3VsdCAxXVxuICAgIEMgLS0-fFR3b3wgRVtSZXN1bHQgMl0iLCJtZXJtYWlkIjp7InRoZW1lIjoiZGVmYXVsdCJ9fQ) with many of the same features as Iemanja.
